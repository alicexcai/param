# PARAM Documentation

## Overview

Parameter exploration is central to work in research, engineering, and design. Everyone hacking together their own bash scripts is a repetitive effor that 1) wastes time and collective brain power and 2) precludes efficient collaboration and communication.

PARAM provides a way to:
* execute batches of commands at various parameters
* store the output data produced
* [TBD] evaluate the output data to make conclusions or continue exploration
* [TBD] visualize data and autogenerate reports (NLP)
